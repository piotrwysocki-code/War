# War
The vision of this project was to design the code in a way that different card games can be created through further refactoring of this code. 

The codebase is extendible and with minor modifications, you can create countless other card games.

The project features include the ability for players to sign up an account or log in. 
User account details are stored in an external file. 
The data written to the file is encrypted on write and decrypted when being accessed within the program.
The game keeps track of your match progress/history. 
Player's match history is also stored in an external file.
